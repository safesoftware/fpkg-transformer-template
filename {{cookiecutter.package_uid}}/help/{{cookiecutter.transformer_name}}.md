## Configuration
### Input Ports
#### Input
This transformer accepts any feature.
### Output Ports
#### Output
- **_greeting:** The greeting based on the given parameters.

#### <Rejected>
Features that cause the operation to fail are output through this port.

which specify the reason for the failure.

**Rejected Feature Handling:** Can be set to either terminate the translation or
continue running when it encounters a rejected feature.
